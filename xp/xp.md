# Cycles

## Project Cycle

- Design Thinking Workshop
- Inception - 1-time-per-project kickoff with developers
  - 2-3 weeks of stories in the backlog
- Iterations
- Pivot / persevere decision

## Weekly Iteration Cycle

- Iteration Planning Meeting (IPM) - Devs, Product Owner, UX - 30m
- Retrospective
  - "If someone makes a mistake, shame on us for making so easy to make that mistake"

## Daily Cycle

- Standup - Product Owner, Devs, the UX - 5m
  - Figure out who's going to pair with whom on what
  - Pairs rotate daily - the "lottery count" ("bus count")
- Work the backlog:
  - choose a story
  - write tests (locally)
  - write code (locally)
  - do user story acceptance
  - pushing code dozens of times per day

## Devops Cycle

- Every git push
  - Continuous Integration build will run automatically
  - Deploy to some lower environment (QA env)
  - (optionally) deploy to Prod whenever master/main is updated
- Developer manually indicates which build should be in prod
  - Continuous Delivery

## TDD Cycle

## Stakeholder Cycle (monthly? as-needed?)

- Playbacks: we converse with other members of the business
- Show and tell: developers geeking out

# Roles

## Developers

- fullstack - K8s, frontend, server-side, persistence, devops pipelines
- everything from CSS all the way to devops

# Architecture

- "Just in time"
- YAGNI - Ya Ain't Gonna Need It
