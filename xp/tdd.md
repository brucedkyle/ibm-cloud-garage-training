# TDD

From Extreme Programming:

We know that testing code helps produce higher quality code (code with fewer bugs). So let's take it to the extreme and write the tests **first**.

Writing tests is a technical skill. Test-Driven Development is a set of **behaviors** that, when followed, increase the value of tests even more.

## Rules of TDD

1. Only write production code in response to a failing test
1. Write the simplest thing to make the test pass

## TDD Behavior - 3 Step

1. **Red** - Write a failing test
1. **Green** - Make the test pass
1. **Refactor** - Make improvements to the code that don't change the behavior
   - Rule of thumb: write "real" code once you've written 3 tests

## Concepts

When you write automated tests, there are two files:

- Your test file
- Your code file (your production code)
