# IBM Cloud Garage Bootcamp Product Presentation

## Purpose

In this Bootcamp we developed an application focused on the four metrics from the landmark DevOps book/study, [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/).

The four metrics are:

1. Deployment Frequency - How many deployments over how many weeks?
1. Lead Time from Commit to Deployment - How long does it take, on average, for commits to get to production?
1. Mean Time to Recover - Amongst all outages, what is the average time it took to get to a recovered application state?
1. Change Failure Rate - What percentage of deployments result in a failure?

## Scenario

You are building a new product that IBM can, one day, sell to its customers. You have just built a prototype and are about to test it. 

This is the playback where you (pretend to) explain the product and prototype to a broader audience in IBM.

Your presentation should:

- be strictly less than 7 minutes in length
- include a demo of your software
- not be just text (name your product and find a logo for it)
- have an arc:
    - what we did (built and shipped an app with these features...)
    - what our (fake) users thought about it / how they use it in real life
    - what we're planning next and why
- Use your **production** environment for the demo
- It's OK to pretend you have users. Not OK to pretend your site does more than it does.

You are allowed to use any tools or references you want to create your presentation and the format of your presentation is entirely up to your Squad.

Get as creative and THINK as far out of the box as you want. Be bold.
