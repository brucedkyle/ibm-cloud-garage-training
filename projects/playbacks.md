# Playbacks

## Goal

To share information you have with a wider audience, and listen to their ideas and concerns in order to generate even better product ideas.

## Format

- 30m-1h
- Short presentation / demo, lots of time for questions and discussion
- Inlcudes Squad (PO, devs, UX designer)
- Includes non-technical stakeholders from other parts of the business

## General Tips

If possible:

- Start with real customer / production data
- Demo with live URLs
- Encourage participants to try the site for themselves
  - Show a QR code on a slide
- Show live analytics dashboards as opposed to screenshots

When it's fake - people will engage in ["bike shedding"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality). This leads to wasteful activities such as:

- focusing on estimates / velocity / predicting release schedules
- wondering when you'll deliver what they designed upfront

## When people ask why you pair

Focus on things that non-technical users will understand:

- improves code quality (more bugs caught earlier in the cycle)
- reduces risk (people leaving a team, mistakes being pushed to prod)

## When people question time spent on devops

Focus on things that make sense to non-technical users:

- it allows us to push changes safely, which means we can push things more frequently
- more frequent feedback leads to higher quality products
