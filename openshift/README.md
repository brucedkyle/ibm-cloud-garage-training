# OpenShift and Kubernetes

## Overview

You write YAML files that describe what you'd like to have.

You apply those YAML files to Kubernetes.

Kubernetes stores your data in a database called `etcd` - this stores the desired state of your application.

The Kubernetes control plane looks at `etcd`, looks at the nodes, then makes the nodes match the desired state.

## Project Setup

### Create the config directory

`cd` into the project you created in the docker lesson and make a `k8s` folder:

```
cd ~/static-site
mkdir k8s
code .
```

### Create the OpenShift Project

Make sure you are logged into the cluster, either with `icc` or via `Copy Login Command`. 

Then run the following command, replacing `<NAME>` with your name, all lowercase, no spaces:

```
oc new-project <NAME>
```

For example `oc new-project john-smith`

## Kubernetes Objects

Kubernetes organizes objects by namespace. In OpenShift, namespaces are called Projects.

There are 4 Kubernetes objects you need to know about to make an application available to the internet:

1. Deployments - specify which image you want to run, and how many pods to create
1. Pods - run containers
1. Services - expose your containers to traffic inside the cluster
1. Routes - expose your services to traffic from outside the cluster

### Deployments

The most basic Kubernetes object you'll work with is a Deployment, which tells Kubernetes:

- which image you would like to run
- how many replicas (instances) you would like to run

**Create the file**

1. Create a file named `k8s/deployment.yaml`
1. Paste the following YAML into the file
1. Replace the word `<USERNAME>` with your quay.io username

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: static-site
  labels:
    app: static-site
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: static-site
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: static-site
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: static-site
        image: quay.io/<USERNAME>/static-site:v1
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

**Apply the file**

```
oc apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
```

**Verify the deployment works**

```
oc get deploy
```

You should see the following:

```
NAME          READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
static-site   1/1     1            1           24s
```

**What just happened?**

When you applied the file, Kubernetes stored your config in `etcd` (the "YAML database").

The control plane saw that you wanted 1 replica of `static-site:v1` running. It looked at the nodes and couldn't find any.

So the scheduler picked a node, and ran one instance of `static-site:v1`.

### Pods

A Deployment creates Pods. You can see pods by running:

```
oc get pods
```

### Services

Services allow pods within a Kubernetes cluster to access the pods from your deployment.

**Create the file**

Create a file named `k8s/service.yaml`

Paste the following YAML into it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: static-site
spec:
  selector:
    app: static-site
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

**Apply the file**

```
oc apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

**Verify **

```
oc get svc
```

You should see something like this (the IP will be different):

```
NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
static-site   ClusterIP   172.21.141.7   <none>        80/TCP    2m6s
```

### Routes

Routes are an OpenShift concept. They serve a similar purpose to Kubernetes Ingresses.

**Create the file**

Create a file named `k8s/route.yaml` and paste the following contents:

```yaml
apiVersion: route.openshift.io/v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: static-site
spec:
  tls:
    termination: edge
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: static-site
    weight: 100
  wildcardPolicy: None
```

**Apply the file**

```
oc apply -f k8s/route.yaml
```

**Verify**

```
oc get routes
```

This will print something like this:

```
NAME          HOST/PORT                       PATH  SERVICES      PORT    TERMINATION   WILDCARD
static-site   static-site-...appdomain.cloud        static-site   <all>   edge          None
```

Copy the `HOST/PORT` and open it in a browser using `https://<URL>`. You should be able to see your site! ðŸŽ‰

## Additional Challenges

Deploy a new version:

- Make a change to `index.html`
- Rebuild and push a new version of your docker image to quay.io (for example `v3`)
- Change `k8s/deployment.yaml` to point to this new version and apply it

Scale the app:

- Make a change to `k8s/deployment.yaml` to increase the number of replicas
- Apply the file
- Use `oc` to list the pods to make sure they are all there
- Repeat the process, but reduce the replicas

## UI

Inspect the app in the UI

## Cleanup

Run the following command to delete your project, replacing `<NAME>` with your project name:

```
oc project default
oc delete project <NAME>
```
