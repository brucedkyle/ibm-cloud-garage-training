# Debugging ICC

- [Cheatsheet](./cheatsheet.md)

## ICC

If you run `icc <cluster-name>` to log into a cluster and you see the following:

```
Logging into ibmcloud: us-south/Default
Logging into OpenShift cluster <cluster-name> with server url https://cXXXX.us-south.containers.cloud.ibm.com:30350
Error from server (InternalError): Internal error occurred: unexpected response: 500
```

It is because you have not yet visited that cluster's OpenShift web console in the browser.

## ibmcloud plugins

There are two plugins that must be installed for ibmcloud, verify they are installed by running the following command:

```shell
ibmcloud plugin list
```

which should print something like the following (versions may be higher):

```shell
Listing installed plug-ins...

Plugin Name                            Version   Status             Private endpoints supported
container-registry                     0.1.518   Update Available   true
container-service/kubernetes-service   1.0.258                      false
```

| Missing Plugin                       | Install command                              |     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | --- |
| container-registry                   | `ibmcloud plugin install container-registry` |     |
| container-service/kubernetes-service | `ibmcloud plugin install container-service`  |     |

## oc sync <project-name> failures

The successful output from this command is:

```shell
Setting up namespace <project-name>
Setting up namespace: <project-name>
Checking for existing project: <project-name>
Creating project: <project-name>
Copying ConfigMaps
Copying Secrets
Setting current project to <project-name>
```

If you do not see all the above output, the command failed. (the code ignores all errors!)
